# Some project features about my website are here : 

* My project is about Building Management. The website is designed to be responsive across various devices, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktops. Utilized media queries and responsive design principles to ensure optimal viewing experience on different screen sizes. 

* Users can create accounts and log in. Once logged in, the Navbar dynamically updates to display the user's profile picture. Users have personalized dashboards. Employed user authentication mechanisms, including JWT for secure login. Integrated conditional rendering to dynamically update the UI based on user authentication status.

* Users can view detailed information about available apartments, including images, floor numbers, block names, and rents. Users can initiate agreements for specific apartments. Populated the apartment data in the database. Implemented pagination for a better user experience. Stored agreement data in the database upon user interaction.

* Depending on the user role (User, Member, Admin), users are directed to a personalized dashboard with relevant functionalities. Utilized protected routes and conditional rendering to ensure users are directed to the appropriate dashboard based on their role. Implemented features such as payment history and announcements based on the user's role.

* Admins have a dedicated dashboard with functionalities like managing members, handling agreement requests, making announcements, and managing coupons. Implemented role-based access control (RBAC) to distinguish between regular users, members, and admins. Admins have additional features for managing the system. Admins can create, view, and modify coupons that users can apply during the payment process to avail discounts on rent. Implemented a coupon management system where admins can add new coupons with details such as code, discount percentage, and description. Applied validation to ensure uniqueness of coupon codes. Added the ability for admins to change the availability status of coupons. During the payment process, users can apply valid coupons to receive discounts on their rent.

* Members can search and filter their payment history based on months, making it convenient to track and review past transactions.  Implemented a search functionality on the payment history page, allowing users and members to filter their transactions based on the month. Utilized a search bar with options to search by either month names or month numbers, providing flexibility to users.
